I have been using frp for two years, this time I am trying to somehow use xtcp using the latest version (0.54.0 as of Feb 28,2024).

I will not post a step-by-step tutorial here. 


## 1. Getting JSON unmarshaling error with default toml config file

For the latest frp, the config file is no longer .ini . Instead, it uses .toml as file extension. So please remember to **add double quote** when you are inputing strings, e.g. ip address.

## 2. VPS Firewall 

I am using Vultr to deploy a VPS for frp server. But I don't know why the firewall in vultr cannot allow specific port to be open..I know there must be a solution, but I don't want to waste time on it , at least for now. 

The issue is like: 

> [W] [service.go:128] login to server failed: dial tcp [$IP]:[$YOURPORT]: i/o timeout.
{: .prompt-warning }

How to solve (do it in your VPS):

### 1. Check the firewall status

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
```

### 2. Add port to the firewall

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=[PORT NUMBER]/tcp --permanent
```

> The port number could be a specific number(1234) or a range (1000-1500)
{: .prompt-tip }

### 3. Update the firewall config

```bash
firewall-cmd --reload
```

## 3. XTCP Auto Fallback

I am too tired to rephrasing what others have written.
